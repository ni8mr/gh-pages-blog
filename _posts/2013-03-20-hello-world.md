Hello, World!

I am a self learner and programmer who is greatly inspired by Elon Musk. May be one day, i can built somethings useful for my friends and families around me. This blog site will showcase some my programming skills which i am learning while completing my daily tasks. Whatever, welcome to my site and any criticism is welcomed if you find anything wrong with the content.
