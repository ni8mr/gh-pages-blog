Hello, World!

I am a self learner and programmer who is greatly inspired by Elon Musk. May be one day, i can built somethings useful for my friends and families around me. This blog site will showcase some my programming skills which i am learning while completing my daily tasks. There are two catagories Bengali and English. I will write the same content in both English and Bengali. In such case, the term "catagory" should be named as "versions!". Whatever, welcome to my site and any criticism is welcomed if you find anything wrong with the content.
